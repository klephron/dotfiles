# Waybar configuration

## Taskbar https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/

Because of these limitations currently taskbar is disabled (too much icons because of separate workspaces resulting to overflow or requiring disabling title in tabs, which I don't want to).

### Issues to be resolved

- Additions to wlr-taskbar like dynamic reduction of title length and taskbar overflow: https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/3897
- Show only opened windows in current workspace (not between monitors like currently): https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/1997
- Bug when moving windows to another monitor that in taskbar in remains when first move occurs but later it switches to different monitor (opposite to where window if located if 2 monitors): https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/2993

### Optional

- Don't force cursor jump when switching to different window using taskbar
